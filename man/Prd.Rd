\usage{
Prd(q, eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{A real number within \eqn{(2,\infty)}}

\item{eps}{A real number within \eqn{(0,\infty)}}
}
\value{
A neural network that takes in \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} and approximately
returns \eqn{xy} when instantiated with ReLU activation, and given a list
c(x,y), the two numbers to be multiplied.

\emph{Note that this must be instantiated with a tuple c(x,y)}
}
\description{
A function that returns the \eqn{\mathsf{Prd}} neural networks that
approximates the product of two real numbers when given an appropriate
\eqn{q}, \eqn{\varepsilon}, a real number \eqn{x} and instantiation with ReLU.
