\usage{
Etr(n, h)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of trapezoids to make. Note this will result in a set of
trapezoids.
Note that this will result in n+1 meshpoints including the starting a and
ending b

\emph{Note: } Upon instantiation with any continuous function this neural
network must be fed with \eqn{n+1} real numbers representing the values
of the function being approximated at the \eqn{n+1} meshpoints which are
the legs of the \eqn{n} triangles as stipulated in the input parameters.}

\item{h}{width of trapezoids}
}
\value{
an approximation for area of the integral
}
\description{
The function that returns the \eqn{\mathsf{Etr}} networks.
}
