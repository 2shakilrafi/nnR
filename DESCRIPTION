Description: Do algebraic operations on neural networks. We seek here to implement
  in R, operations on neural networks and their resulting approximations. Our operations derives
  its descriptions mainly from 
  Rafi S., Padgett, J.L., and Nakarmi, U. (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2402.01058> 
  Grohs P., Hornung, F., Jentzen, A. et al. (2023) <doi:10.1007/s10444-022-09970-2>
  Jentzen A., Kuckuck B., von Qurstemberger, P. (2023) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.20360>
  Our implementation is meant mainly as a pedagogical tool, and proof of concept. Faster implementations with 
  deeper vectorizations may be made in future versions. 
  Our definitions derive mainly from the following.
