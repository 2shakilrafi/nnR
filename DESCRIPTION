Version: 0.1.0
Author: Shakil Rafi
Maintainer: Shakil Rafi <sarafi@uark.edu>
Description: Do algebraic operations on neural networks. We seek here to implement
  in R, operations on neural networks and their resulting approximations. Our implementation
  is meant mainly as a pedagogical tool, and proof of concept. Faster implementations with 
  deeper vectorizations may be made in future versions. 
  Our definitions derive mainly from the following -
